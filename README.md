Plotly Deploy (Data Visualization in Javascript)

Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to help finish her partially completed “Belly Button Biodiversity” dashboard. This analysis will enhance the performance of the dashboard and help visualize the bacterial data for each volunteer. Specifically, her volunteers should be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons after this analysis.  That way, if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, Roza's volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.

Results

A responsive html page was created to visualize the bacterial data for each volunteer.  The link to the html page is  Belly Button Biodiversity (hurpey.github.io).

Deliverables from the analysis performed are as follows:

1.	A Horizontal Bar Chart showing the top 10 cultures found for each test subject ID number. The result for the Bar Chart is updated as the test subject ID number is changed or updated. For instance, Fig 1.2 and Fig 1.4 below show the results for test subject ID numbers 940 and 943 respectively.


2.	A Bubble Chart showing the bacteria cultures per sample.  The result for the Bubble Chart is updated as the test subject ID number is changed or updated. For instance, Fig 1.3 and Fig 1.6 below show the results for test subject ID numbers 940 and 943 respectively.

3.	A Gauge Chart showing the Belly Button Washing Frequency (scrubs per week). The result for the Gauge Chart is updated as the test subject ID number is changed or updated. For instance, Fig 1.1 and Fig 1.5 below show the results for test subject ID numbers 940 and 943 respectively.
